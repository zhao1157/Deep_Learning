# Deep_Learning_A_Z

This repository is to archive the code templates of different deep learning neural networks I learnt in the Udemy course [Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks](https://www.udemy.com/deeplearning/). The core of the code templates is from that course, however, I organized different parts in my favor and even improved some of the original templates. I am still learning and exploring different deep leanring neural networks and will archive those in this repository too.
